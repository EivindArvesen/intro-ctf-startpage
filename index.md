### Steps

Before the CTF starts, you need to go register your team details in the [scoreboard](https://ctf.bouvetmove.no/) app (one account per team). There should be two players on every team.

Once the CTF starts, you can use the ‚ÄúChallenges‚Äù screen to enter your flags. You should search for the challenge name on the challenges screen.

If you miss your flag for some reason, you can go to the scoreboard screen of the vulnerable application and click on the green button to see it again.
